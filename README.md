# Telegram DHL Bot (WIP)
Another Project with the main intention of learning Python. The purpose of this application is to get updates about my DHL package status through Telegram.

The first functioning version is live on Heroku.
## Topics that I am learning and training during this development
1. Use of API's
    - Using the DHL API to get my package status: I already used an API on another project, but this was a good refreshment;
2. Writing a Telegram Bot: Even being a bot in it's most simple form, the concept of having something that I can interact with whenever I want and not just a code that runs from start to finish is a quite new and interesting concept I am fascinated about;
3. Using Git Branches 
    - What I am doing here probably is a bit of an overkill, but the idea is to get used to use the 'Develop' and 'feature/[feature]' branches and, in this way, learn to respect the git flow;
4. Deploying to Heroku
    - Since I wanted an actually functioning bot and not just something for test purposes, I had to find some place to host it. I learned quite fast about Heroku and found the opportunity to learn how to deploy my bot and with it, how to put code into production. This was another interesting step within my programming/python journey.
