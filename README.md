# Telegram DHL Bot (WIP)
Another Project with the main intention of learning Python. The purpose of this application is to get updates about my DHL package status through Telegram.
First functioning version live on Heroku.
## Topics Being Learned
1. Use of API's
    - Using the DHL API to get my package status.
2. Writing a Telegram Bot
3. Using Git Branches 
    - What I am doing here probably is a bit of an overkill, but the idea is to get used to use the 'Develop' and 'feature/[feature]' branches and, in this way, learn to respect the git flow.
